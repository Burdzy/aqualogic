# aqualogic
A python library to interface with a Hayward/Goldline AquaLogic pool controller. Based on Goldline prototol decoding work done by draythomp (http://www.desert-home.com/p/swimming-pool.html).

Requires an RS-485 interface; I'm using this one: http://www.usriot.com/products/rs485-to-ethernet-converter.html. Set the port to 19200-N-8-2.
